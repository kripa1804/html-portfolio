<h1>The best movies according to Kripa!</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Father of the bride</h3>
<p>This movie is dedicated to all daughters and dads!
   The typical emotional, possessive and of course jealous 'dad' played by none other than Steve Martin
   tries to capture the beautiful relationship of dad and daughter as its time for her to pack her bags and bid adieu to her folks
   while the dad needs to figure out how to cope up with the fact that things would never be the same with his little angel again!<p>
   </p>
<h3>Indecent proposal</h3>
<p>Loyalty in relationship? Nothing can beat a story like this one. Demi Moore in the lead is something you would not want to miss!</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Robert J Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb! Yes. But the crux of the concept is the pricking conscience of bringing to the world
   something that has the ability to cause a catastrophe to innocents that have no say whatsoever! Must watch.
